# Documentation for PerCL

The Performance Command Language (PerCL) defines a set of instructions, written in JSON format, that express telephony actions to be performed in response to an event on the FreeClimb platform. FreeClimb communicates with the application server when events associated with the application occur, so the webserver can instruct FreeClimb how to handle such events using PerCL scripts.

## PerCL example generation

```python
import freeclimb

say = freeclimb.Say(text="Hello! This is a message sent using FreeClimb's Python SDK.")
return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(say.to_dict())
```

The JSON object below represents the PerCL object generated by the commands above.

```json
[
    {
        "Say" : {
            "text" : "Hello! This is a message sent using FreeClimb's Python SDK."
        }
    }
]
```

## AddToConference

The AddToConference command adds a Participant to a Conference. If this Participant currently is in another Conference, the Participant is first removed from that Conference. Two Call legs can be bridged together by creating a Conference and adding both Call legs to it via AddToConference.

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

addToConference = freeclimb.AddToConference(conference_id='CF_your_conference_id', call_id='CA_your_call_id')
return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(addToConference.to_dict())
```

### Attributes:

Name | Type | Description | Required
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
conference_id | string | ID of the Conference to which to add the Participant (Call leg). Conference must exist or an error will result. | Required
call_id | string | ID of the Call that will be added to the specified Conference. The Call must be in progress or an error will result. | Required
start_conf_on_enter | boolean | Flag that indicates whether a Conference starts upon entry of this particular Participant. | Optional
talk | boolean | If true, the Participant joins the Conference with talk privileges. | Optional
listen | boolean | If true, the Participant joins the Conference with listen privileges. This may be modified later via the REST API or SetListen PerCL command. | Optional
allow_call_control | boolean | If true, Call control will be enabled for this Participant's Call leg. | Optional
call_control_sequence | string | Defines a sequence of digits that, when entered by this caller, invokes the call_control_url. Only digits plus '*', and '#' may be used. | Required only when allow_call_control is set to true
call_control_url | absolute URL | URL to be invoked when this Participant enters the digit sequence defined in the callControlSequence attribute. | Required only when allow_call_control is set to true
leave_conference_url | absolute URL | URL to be invoked when the Participant leaves the Conference via any of the following methods: RemoveFromConference,TerminateConference, Conference Participant API DELETE request, Conference API POST request with status=empty, Conference API POST request with status=terminated, Participant hangs up | optional
notification_url | absolute URL | When the Participant enters the Conference, this URL will be invoked using an HTTP POST request with the standard request parameters. |optional

## CreateConference

The CreateConference command does exactly what its name implies â€” it creates an unpopulated Conference (one without any Participants). Once created, a Conference remains in FreeClimb until explicitly terminated by a customer. Once a Conference has been terminated, it can no longer be used.

CreateConference is a terminal command (any actions following it are never executed). When the Conference is successfully created, FreeClimb invokes the provided actionUrl using an HTTP POST with a createConference Webhook as the body. After this request, control picks up using the PerCL code received in the response.

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

conference = freeclimb.CreateConference(action_url='http://example.com/action', status_callback_url='http://example.com/status')
return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(conference.to_dict())
```

### Attributes:

Name | Type | Description | Required
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
action_url | absolute URL | This URL is invoked once the Conference is successfully created. | Required
alias | string | Descriptive name for the Conference. | Optional
play_beep | **always**, **never**, **entryOnly**, or **exitOnly** | Indicates whether to play a beep when a Participant enters or leaves the Conference. | Optional
record | boolean | When set to true, the entire Conference is recorded. The statusCallbackUrl of the Conference will receive a conferenceRecordingEnded Webhook when the Conference transitions from the inProgress to empty state. | Optional
wait_url | absolute URL | If specified, this URL provides the custom hold music for the Conference when it is in the populated state. | Optional
status_callback_url | This URL is invoked when the status of the Conference changes or when a recording of the Conference has become available. | Optional

## Dequeue

The Dequeue command transfers control of a Call that is in a Queue so that the waiting caller exits the Queue. Execution continues with the first command in the PerCL script returned by the actionUrl specified in the Enqueue command.

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

dequeue = freeclimb.Dequeue()
return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(dequeue.to_dict())
```

### Attributes:

Name | Type | Description | Required
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Dequeue does not support any attributes

## Enqueue

The Enqueue command adds the current Call to a call Queue. If the specified Queue does not exist, it is created and then the Call is added to it. The default maximum length of the queue is 100. This can be modified using the REST API.

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

enqueue = freeclimb.Enqueue(queue_id='QU_your_queue_id', wait_url='http://example.com/wait', action_url='http://example.com/action')
return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(enqueue.to_dict())
```

### Attributes:

action_url | absolute URL | A request is made to this URL when the Call leaves the Queue, which can occur if enqueue of the Call fails or when the call is dequeued via the Dequeue command, the REST API (POST to Queue Member resource), or the caller hangs up | Required
wait_url | absolute URL | Specifies a URL pointing to a PerCL script containing actions to be executed while the caller is waiting in the Queue. | Required
notification_url | absolute URL | URL to be invoked when the call enters the queue. | Optional

## GetDigits

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

get_digits = freeclimb.GetDigits(action_url='http://example.com', max_digits=1, min_digits=1, flush_buffer=True)
return freeclimb.PerCLCommand.to_json(get_digits.to_dict())
```

enforcePCI | boolean | Parameter enforcePCI obscures the result as required by PCI compliance. | Optional

## GetSpeech

The GetSpeech command enables the Caller to respond to the application using a supported language. Unlike DTMF entry, which implicitly restricts the user to using the available buttons on the phone key pad, speech input allows for flexible audio inputs based on grammar. FreeClimb supports grammars written using GRXML compatible with the Microsoft Speech Platform.

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

get_speech = freeclimb.GetSpeech(action_url='http://example.com/action', grammar_type='BUILTIN', grammar_file='VERSAY_YESNO')

enforcePCI | boolean | Parameter enforcePCI will not log the 'text' as required by PCI compliance. | optional

## Hangup

The Hangup command terminates a Call. If Hangup is used as the first action in a PerCL response, it does not prevent FreeClimb from answering the Call and billing your account. See the Reject command to hang up at no charge.

call_id | string | The ID of the Call leg to hang up. If not specified, the Call leg corresponding to the current PerCL execution context hangs up. | Optional
reason | string | The user defined reason for the hangup. In general, applications should use a set of enumerated values that are predefined to cover all exit points of the Call flows for the given application. | Optional

## OutDial

The OutDial command is used to call a phone number.

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

outdial = freeclimb.OutDial(action_url='http://example.com/action', call_connect_url='http://example.com/action', calling_number='+1XXXXXXXXXX', destination='+1XXXXXXXXXX')

### Example:

```python
import freeclimb

play_early_media = freeclimb.PlayEarlyMedia(file='http://example.com/greeting.wav')

------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
call_id | string | ID of the Call leg to be removed from the Conference. The Call must be in a Conference or an error will be triggered. | Required

## Say

The Say command provides Text-To-Speech (TTS) support. It converts text to speech and then renders it in a female voice back to the caller. Say is useful in cases where it's difficult to pre-record a prompt for any reason. Say does not allow barge-in unless nested within a GetSpeech command. The file will always be played to completion unless nested.

### Example:
