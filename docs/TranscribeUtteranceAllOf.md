# TranscribeUtteranceAllOf

The `TranscribeUtterance` command transcribes the callerâ€™s voice and returns transcription of the audio and optionally returns the recording of the audio transcribed.  `TranscribeUtterance` is blocking and is a terminal command. As such, the actionUrl property is required, and control of the Call picks up using the `PerCL` returned in response of the `actionUrl`. Recording and Transcription information is returned in the actionUrl request. If the reason this command ended was due to the call hanging up, any PerCL returned will not execute.
